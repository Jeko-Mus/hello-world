Learning to use github
Hi, My name is Jeko and I have been learning to code for about 4 months now and thoroughly enjoying it. As much as there is so much new information to learn, the things I have learnt have been mindblowing to say the least. Coding is so much more efficient compared to so many other ways of doing things even for everyday normal personal things that need to be done!
